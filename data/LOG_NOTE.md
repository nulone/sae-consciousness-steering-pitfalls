# Note on exp_h_v2.log

This log was generated by an earlier version of exp_h_definitive_v2.py.
The verdict line "Paper features significantly WORSE than random (lower-tail p=0.0267)"
uses the **unconditional** lower-tail p-value, which is misleading because 140/150
random pairs produced exactly zero delta (features inactive on all prompts).

The current version of the script and the canonical writeup (supplementary/full_writeup.md)
report **both** unconditional and conditional p-values and correctly identify the
conditional p=0.40 (among 10 active pairs) as the informative test.

See full_writeup.md Section "Experiment 9 (EXP H v2)" for discussion.
